                    <h2>Sole Mission: Reviving Every Step</h2>
                    <p>“Because Every Step Deserves a Clean Slate”. Sole Mission was born out of a practical observation and a touch of laziness. The founders noticed that people would go to great lengths to clean even their carpets, so why not their shoes? This insight inspired them to create a niche in specialized shoe cleaning and restoration services.</p>
                    <p>The concept was initially sparked by the founders’ previous partners, while one of the key members focused on the marketing and innovation side. They started with basic cleaning services in 2021, but as the business grew, so did their expertise. One of the founders took it upon themselves to learn the intricacies of shoe repainting and reglueing, ensuring they could offer comprehensive solutions to their clients.</p>
                    <p>Still running strong to this day, Sole Mission provides a wide range of services, from deep cleaning and stain removal to color restoration, damage repair, sole reglueing, and material refreshment. With meticulous attention to detail, they strive to make each pair of shoes look as good as new, extending their lifespan and preserving their value.</p>

                    <p>By availing <strong>Mission's Shoe Restoration service</strong>, you agree to the following terms and conditions:</p>
                    <p>1. You may cancel the shoe restoration service at any time before the process begins. However, any downpayment made will not be refunded after work has started, as it covers the assessment and materials required for the restoration.</p>
                    <p>2. Sole Mission is not responsible for any damage or loss that occurs during delivery by a third- party courier service, either to or from our facility. It is the customer's responsibility to ensure that shoes are properly packed and insured during shipment. We recommend using a reliable courier service with tracking and insurance. Sole Mission also offers pickup and delivery services with fee, available for a limited area only.</p>
                    <p>3. If the shoes are not picked up within 2 months from the completion of the restoration, Sole Mission reserves the right to dispose of or sell the shoes without returning the downpayment to the owner. We will notify you before this action is taken.</p>
                    <p>4. While we take all necessary precautions to protect your shoes, we are not liable for any damage that occurs during the restoration process due to the current condition of the shoes. This includes any pre-existing damage, wear, or fragility that may affect the restoration. However, if damage occurs due to our negligence during the restoration process, we will conduct an investigation and take appropriate corrective actions.</p>
                    <p>5. While we strive to restore your shoes to their best possible condition, Sole Mission does not guarantee a factory-finish result. The final output may vary due to the existing condition of the shoes and the nature of the restoration process.</p>
                    <p>By proceeding with our Shoe Restoration service, you confirm that you understand and agree to the above terms and conditions.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">If you agree to these terms, please reply with:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"I agree to the terms and conditions."</strong></p>

                    <p>1. An assessment will be conducted upon receipt of your pair(s). The condition of the shoes will be evaluated, and cleaning services will be initiated thereafter.</p>
                    <p>2. The estimated processing time for Deep Clean services is 3-5 business days from the date the shoes are received and assessed.</p>
                    <p>3. Full payment is required from the date your pair(s) are received and assessed. The cleaning process will commence once payment has been made.</p>

Our goal is to return the sole to its original color, achieving at least 80% - 90% of the original shade and maintaining its original state. We limit the unyellowing process to a maximum of 4 sessions to avoid any potential damage to the sole or other parts of the shoe.</p>

The success of the reglue process may vary depending on the condition of the shoe and the extent of the damage. We aim to restore the shoe's functionality, but cannot guarantee the longevity of the repair.</p>

However, if damage occurs due to our negligence during the service, an investigation will be conducted, and appropriate corrective actions will be taken.</p>
